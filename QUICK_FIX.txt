# 🚀 LOGIN FIX - DO THESE 3 THINGS

## ⚡ THING #1: DEPLOY RIGHT NOW

```bash
# In your Valentine folder
vercel --prod
```

Wait for: `✓ Production: https://valentine-69oxnc8pq-velkanis-projects.vercel.app`

---

## 🔍 THING #2: CHECK WHAT'S SET ON VERCEL

Visit this URL (after deployment completes):

```
https://valentine-69oxnc8pq-velkanis-projects.vercel.app/api/debug
```

**You should see:**
- `"adminUsernameValue": "Velkani"`
- `"adminPasswordValue": "ILoveRaajiS"`

**If you see different values or `null`:**
→ Go to Vercel Settings → Environment Variables and FIX THEM

---

## 🔐 THING #3: TRY LOGIN

Go to:
```
https://valentine-69oxnc8pq-velkanis-projects.vercel.app/login
```

Username: `Velkani`
Password: `ILoveRaajiS`

Click Login

## ✅ IF THIS WORKS, YOU'RE DONE! 🎉

## ❌ IF THIS DOESN'T WORK:

Tell me what the `/api/debug` endpoint showed.

That's it! One URL shows us exactly what's wrong.
